Pick a style appropriate to the individual who told you the story, and the organizational culture where you are developing the system. Stories should capture the environment through narratives, and experiences through dialogues. Narratives can be told in the 3rd person or in the 1st person. For example, a designer can maintain a narrative of their personal experience of an environment in the form of a journal. Dialogues should capture the personalities of the individuals participating in conversations, emotions, and the context in which they occur. Woven together, narratives and dialogues give strong foundations for system design.');

Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn&#x27;t have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere.
