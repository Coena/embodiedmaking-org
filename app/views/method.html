          Perhaps humanity’s defining trait is our ability to craft elegant solutions in face of adversity, complexity, and carcity. Starting from our early ancestors who fashioned their tools using little more than wood, stone, and sinew to the more recent inventions of steam and electric engines, our history is testament to transformations in our societies on the strengths of our solutions. Some transformations are an intended consequence of the invention, such as the use of
    steam engines to make faster travel possible. Other consequences are unintended, such as the excessive pollution created as a consequence of our industrialized societies.

          Making elegant solutions becomes harder as our societies
    grow more complex. A solution with a physical form, such
    as a household appliance, must provide utility, possess
    ergonomic qualities, utilize materials that do no harm its
    users, and withstand a variety of situations both intended
    and accidental. A solution that consists of several interrelated
    solutions, such as an office building with specialised
    rooms, must be able to balance individual and collective
    needs. An intangible solution, such as a business practice or
    procedure, must be learnable and teachable, be adaptive to
    varying situations, and be capable of refinement with usage.

          How do we ensure our solutions bring about positive
    changes in our societies and avoid creating unintended consequences
    such as waste or pollution? Embodied making is
    a method for realizing solutions for complex environments
    with a high scale of interwoven problems. Solutions are realised
    together with the people who live and work in those
    environments every day by first understanding and recording
    their experiences in the form of stories. Stories provide
    insight about the forces that shape an environment, such
    as a story about the lack of inter-departmenal cooperation
    in a company can reveal several forces, one of which can be
    departmental goals taking precedence over organisational
    goals. Through deep contemplation about the body of forces
    revealed through several stories, solutions can be discovered
    that solve the these forces in the most elegant manner.

          How do ensure our solutions truly solve the problems posed
    by an environment rather than satisfying our needs as designers
    or makers first, such as an affinity with a trend? Or
    that our solutions aren’t the result of our limited knowledge
    or familiarity with a breed of solutions? Embodied making
    is also an attitude for problem solving through the appreciative
    participation of the people who live and work in that
    environment. Embodied makers work with rather than for
    people, play a facilitative role in understanding an environment
    by faithfully recording narratives as they are related
    to them, possess a learning attitude to understand the complexity
    present in an environment, and are adept at coming
    up with solutions that balance forces elegantly by being
    deeply critical of their own ideas through introspection.

          Embodied making is applied in the same way to make
    household appliances, software systems, organisations, or
    cities. It complements other methods of analysis, engineering,
    construction, and manufacturing by helping understand
    and structure genuine needs, qualitative criteria, and
    intangibles such as influence and power. Environments with
    high complexity usually require makers to use structured
    techniques for recording, categorising and visualising stories,
    forces, and solutions. Mastery in the method is gradually
    obtained when makers are able to extract and refine
    the formative stories in an environment, cognitively balance
    a high scale of forces, and formulate solutions that resolve
    forces and embrace stories elegantly.

Humans possess an extraordinary ability to craft the environment around
them into all sorts of useful objects, ranging from cups, bicycles, paper to
door handles. Even more extraordinary is our ability to learn about these
objects, and with a little practice, use them seemingly little thought. When
we drink a hot beverage from a familiar cup, we expend little thought into that first careful sip to gauge temperature, the measured sips as the beverage
cools, and the carefree swigs after the beverage has cooled. If we want to
drink a hot beverage over a good conversation with a friend, we may use
a large cup, so that it can contain enough coffee or tea to last the whole
conversation, thick enough not to scald our fingers, yet thin enough to warm or hands on a cold winter evening, and with large handles to afford nestling
several fingers to lift its heavy contents and body. To drink a glass of water, we
would probably use a clear glass so that we can can hold it up to sunlight to
ensure that the water is free from floating particles, broad enough so we can
encircle all of our fingers to get a firm grip, with a heavy base so that it doesn’t topple over easily, and tall enough to quench our thirst. The shape of cups
and glasses have held a stable form as the manner in which we drink from
them has not changed since their inception. Adaptation, if at all, has occurred
with the emergence of new materials and methods of ornamentation to balance
the forces around their cleaning (e.g. dishwashing machines), usage (e.g. heating in microwaves), and storage (e.g. refrigerators). In contrast, the forms
of clothing for the same human form around the world have near infinite variety
reflecting the varying forces of climate, vegetation, culture, belief systems,
community, and individuality. Some clothing trends such as hoop skirts and
whalebone corsets were short-lived, partially because they relied on unsustainable
practices like extensive whaling. Sarongs, shirts, tunics, and trousers,
on the other hand, have a timeless appeal by their ability to resolve a large
scale of forces consistently over time. Making timeless and elegant forms is
hard, as the forces that seem stable today may not be so for long. Embodied
making helps understand complexity to make such timeless forms.</div>
