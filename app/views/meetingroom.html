            The process of design with embodied making starts with
            listening to people in the space where we want our designs
            to live and rest. Stories are anecdotes as people relate them
            to us, and these are faithfully recorded as they are told to us.<br>

            What induces people to behave in the way they do in their environments? Or motivates them to decide on a particular course of action? These factors are called forces in embodied making. We can identify some of these forces from the stories:<br>

      <br>Stories should be gathered from several perspectives. In the example of the meeting room, stories from the users of meeting rooms, building security, receptionists, moderators of meetings, visitors to the building to who come for a meeting, maintenance staff, or cleaning staff will help create a rich tapestry as the basis of designs. As we catalog more and more stories from different perspectives, more and more forces will emerge. The objective of enumerating forces isn’t to try and find as many forces as possible. In order to give designers a feeling of the space where their designs will live and rest, the objective is to capture an adequate number of forces for reflection. Understanding the interactions between forces helps designers live and experience them.</i></div>

          <div class="pannel-body infoblock-examples">
            If we are able to find an elegant solution that is both stable and reliable, and this solution would be able to balance all of these forces (let’s assume for now that these stories and forces are complete), we would have created a system that would fulfill the requirements of sharing meeting rooms effectively. We can gain insight into how these forces exist in their environments by exploring how they interact with each other, by placing a (+) sign for a pleasant experience, a (-) sign for an unpleasant experience, and (~) for a neutral experience.

        <br>For each interaction, try and imagine situations where those
        interactions between forces would occur. By thinking about each interaction,
        you will increasingly understand how all of these forces co-exist in the same
        space. Understanding the complex interactions has a meditative quality, and
        after while, a feeling of “living” the forces occurs for the designer. Throughout
        this process, the personal goals and objectives of the designer or designers
        should be explicitly stated as wills. Interactions between wills and forces
        reveal their conduciveness to exist in the same space. As we think about the
        forces, and the interactions between forces, ideas will flow on how to resolve
        them. Each idea should be written down as a solution component, examining
        how it helps resolves the immediate forces we have considered, and all the
        forces that emerge afterwards.

        <br>There is no fixed sequence on writing any of
        them down. In this example, we want to create compassion and empathy,
        and we can achieve this by finding analogies or metaphors that inspire those
        emotions. As there is a natural tendency for human beings to care for their
        pets, associating the keys to animals transfers some of this care to the keys.
        Animals should be selected for the vulnerability, and a connection to the
        planet can be found through featuring endangered animals. By introducing
        gameplay at the key moments when keys are the most likely to go missing,
        moments susceptible to mishap can be averted.
