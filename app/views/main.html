                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <h3>Embodied making is a sensemaking and problem-solving method for complex situations. It uses stories of the people in those situations to understand their experiences. Forces, or the reasons those situations occur, are derived from stories or directly from experience. The forces are balanced and resolved by solutions. The entirety of solutions are inter-purposed through patterns.</h3>

We all live with the solutions of modern society around us, ranging from public transport systems to coffee machines. We all need to sense of the complexity around us, and be sure that our choices are balancing the forces around us.</h3>
