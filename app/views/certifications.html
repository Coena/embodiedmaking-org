            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><p>You probably don’t need any formal training for solving simple problems. You have probably used stories to explain experiences of your problems to others and reason about why these problems occur with them. You have probably come up good ideas to solve these problems, and everytime you applied your ideas, they probably got better. When you’re trying to solve a problem for yourself, such as deciding what mobile device to purchase or which job to apply for, it is relatively easy to resolve your personal experiences and motivations with good solutions. Solving problems that involve friends and family can more complex, such as deciding where to go vacationing together or selecting a new place to live. If all of you understand each other well, chances are you’ll find good solutions together. Solving problems with several people you do not know well in unfamiliar environments is more difficult, such as structuring a business venture, building an organizational structure, and sustaining work culture.</p></div>
                
             <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6"><p>These individuals can have different experiences of the same problem, varying notions of what they consider to be problems, and different opinions of what works well and doesn’t. If some individuals have more power or influence than others in the group, their opinions usually hold more sway than others, and the convictions of a few decide the solutions for the many. And it isn’t usually a single solution applied in isolation that works well in these complex environments, but several solutions applied simultaneously by many people in different spaces. This requires solutions to be structured in terms of each other. Each solution must be able to support, strengthen, and affirm each other. This is the practice of solution-weaving. Embodied Making is best applied in these complex situations with some formalisms to cope with the scale of the experiences, problems, and opinions.</p></div>
